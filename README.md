# SeeSaw-5766-neoPixel-Driver
C implementation to drive neoPixels using the AdaFruit SeeSaw 5766 I2C neoPixel interface board

The code in this repo was developed to drive neoPixel devices from the Avnet RASynBoard leveraging a Renesas RA6M4 MCU.  The code was developed in the Renesas e2 studio so there are some e2 studio specific calls.  Feel free to use this code in your project.  I make no quality guarantees or claims to completeness.
